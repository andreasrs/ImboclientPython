======================

A client for Imbo written in Python

Installation
============

Package will be deployed to pip repositories shortly, after a few backwards-compatible-break-inducing changes have been made to this client. See list of current issues on Github for an overview.
Until then you can install it directly from Github:

pip install git+git://github.com/andreasrs/ImboclientPython.git

Only Python 2.7 is tested/verified at the moment, virtualenv is recommended.

USAGE
=====

For a quick overview of the current functionality refer to the integration tests that perform simple operations with the client (self._client) [here](https://github.com/andreasrs/ImboclientPython/blob/master/imboclient/test/integration/test_client.py)

The basic operations work at the moment, but the return-values from various functions are a bit incosistent and will be fixed in the near future.
